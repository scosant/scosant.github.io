With the final release of Firefox 3.6 just around the corner, I was curious how the release candidate stacked up against the Chrome on Snow Leopard. I did not include Safari benchmarks since I rarely use it. I also opted to benchmark an Intel optimized build of Firefox.

#### System

- Unibody MacBook Pro 15"
- 2.4Ghz Core 2 Duo
- 4gb RAM
- GeForce 9400M + 9600M GT w/ 256mb

#### Browsers

- Mozilla Firefox (Namoroka) 3.6rc1 (Intel Optimized by [C. Latko](http://www.latko.org/))
- Google Chrome 4.0.295.0 (Developer Release)

#### SunSpider JavaScript Benchmark

Chrome was approximately twice as fast as Firefox (overall) in JavaScript. Results can be found at:

- [Firefox 3.6rc1](http://j.mp/7nH2rg)
- [Chrome 4.0.295.0](http://j.mp/bT3Wwm)

#### Futuremark Peacekeeper Browser Benchmark
