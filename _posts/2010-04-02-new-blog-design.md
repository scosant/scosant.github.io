Trying out the new draft Blogger mode.&nbsp; It has tons of new customization options like resizing page sections, making certain background transparent and more control over fonts and color.&nbsp; However, there are only a handful of new templates and the editing mode is still buggy.&nbsp; You can try it out by visiting <a href="http://draft.blogger.com/">http://draft.blogger.com</a>.&nbsp; I also upgraded the Syntax Highlighter to version 2.0.&nbsp; Source can be found at <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/wiki/SyntaxHighlighter">Alex Gorbatchev's site</a> and instructions for using it in blogger are <a href="http://www.craftyfella.com/2010/01/syntax-highlighting-with-blogger-engine.html">here</a>.
